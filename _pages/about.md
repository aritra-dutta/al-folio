Hello! I am Aritra. I graduated with a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Central Florida. My research is mainly focused on the weighted and structured low-rank approximation of matrices and their applications in machine learning and computer vision. Additionally, I work on the applications of compressive sensing to automatic target recognition. As a result of my work, I have developed a deep understanding of the following areas of mathematics: non-linear optimization, convex optimization, and numerical analysis. Presently I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the VCC, KAUST with Prof. Peter Richtarik.
